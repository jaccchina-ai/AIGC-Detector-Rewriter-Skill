# AIGC Detector & Rewriter Skill

**A conservative AI-writing risk detection and thesis rewriting skill for English and Chinese academic writing.**

This skill helps identify and reduce AI-generated writing-risk patterns in master’s thesis text while preserving academic meaning, citations, variables, hypotheses, statistical results, and document structure.

It is designed for users who need careful, detector-informed academic revision, especially for thesis chapters affected by **Turnitin AI**, **CNKI AIGC**, or other external AI detection reports.

> This is not a detector-bypass tool.
> It does not guarantee any AI detector score.
> It focuses on minimal, evidence-preserving revision and academic integrity.

## Core Principle

This skill follows one central rule:

> **Reduce AI-writing risk by minimally editing the original thesis text, not by regenerating it.**

The skill does **not** rewrite a chapter from scratch. It does **not** replace the author’s work with fluent AI-generated prose. Instead, it works sentence by sentence and paragraph by paragraph to reduce detectable writing patterns while keeping the original academic content intact.

Allowed operations include:

* Substituting individual words
* Reordering clauses where safe
* Splitting overly balanced sentences
* Recasting repeated sentence openings
* Reducing formulaic transitions
* Making existing reasoning more visible
* Reorganizing paragraph architecture without changing meaning
* Relocating existing author reasoning when traceable
* Preserving or increasing word count when required

Forbidden operations include:

* Whole-paragraph regeneration
* Whole-chapter rewriting
* Back-translation
* Detector-bypass rewriting
* Third-party humanizer rewriting
* Fabricating data, citations, examples, quotes, or researcher voice
* Changing variables, hypotheses, coefficients, p-values, or conclusions
* Claiming that an external detector score has improved without a comparable external re-test

---

## Why This Skill Exists

Many AI rewriting tools make academic text more fluent, smoother, and more polished. That can make the text look **more AI-generated**, not less.

This skill is built around the opposite strategy:

* Keep as much original author wording as possible
* Avoid over-polishing
* Preserve non-native but acceptable academic style
* Break repeated structures without deleting content
* Treat detector scores as external evidence, not as something the model can predict
* Work chapter by chapter with external re-testing

The goal is not to create perfect native-speaker prose.
The goal is to preserve the author’s thesis while reducing structural AI-writing risk.

---

## Main Features

### 1. Multi-Layer AI-Writing Risk Analysis

The skill checks AI-risk signals at different levels:

| Level           | Risk Examples                                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sentence level  | repeated openings, uniform rhythm, excessive transitions               |
| Paragraph level | mechanical claim-explanation-conclusion structure                      |
| Section level   | repeated literature review, hypothesis, or results-reporting templates |
| Chapter level   | long continuous detector-highlighted fragments                         |
| Document level  | repeated architecture across multiple chapters                         |

---

### 2. English and Chinese Route Separation

English and Chinese thesis text are handled differently.

| Text Type           | Method                                                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| English thesis text | Uses the D1–D17 academic AI-risk dimension framework      |
| Chinese thesis text | Uses Chinese AI-risk phrase and structure checks          |
| Mixed-language text | Routes each segment according to language                 |
| Qualitative text    | Adds qualitative-specific risk checks                     |
| Quantitative text   | Adds methodology and empirical-reporting structure checks |

This prevents Chinese thesis text from being incorrectly judged by English-only AI-writing indicators.

---

### 3. Detector-Informed but Not Detector-Dependent

The skill can use external detector reports as calibration signals, including:

* Turnitin AI reports
* CNKI AIGC reports
* GPTZero-style reports
* Originality-style reports
* Highlighted AI-risk fragments
* Chapter-level AI scores
* Whole-document AI scores

However, the skill does not claim to simulate or predict any detector.

Internal risk scores are only used for diagnosis and prioritization.
Only a real external re-test can confirm whether the detector score changed.

---

### 4. Minimal-Edit Thesis Rewriting

The rewriting process protects:

* Original academic meaning
* Research logic
* Variables and abbreviations
* Hypotheses
* Citations
* Reference names
* Statistical values
* Coefficients
* p-values
* Table and figure numbers
* Methodological claims
* Qualitative quotes
* Participant meaning
* Chapter and paragraph structure

Every rewritten paragraph must pass quality gates before being accepted.

---

### 5. Chapter-by-Chapter Closed Loop

The recommended workflow is:

1. Build a chapter version ledger
2. Record current external detector scores
3. Select the highest-risk chapter
4. Diagnose paragraph and section risks
5. Rewrite only the selected high-risk areas
6. Run quality gates
7. Ask the user to re-test the chapter externally
8. Accept the new version only if the external re-test improves
9. Continue to the next target chapter only after confirmation

A chapter is considered done only when its measured external AI score is below the target threshold.

Default target: **below 30%**, unless the user specifies another threshold.

---

## Typical Use Cases

This skill is useful for:

* Master’s thesis AI-writing risk reduction
* English thesis revision for non-native authors
* Chinese thesis CNKI AIGC risk review
* Turnitin AI report response
* Chapter-level AI detector remediation
* Literature review de-templating
* Hypothesis-development rewriting
* Methodology section revision
* Empirical results reporting improvement
* Discussion and conclusion rewriting
* Qualitative interview findings improvement
* Mixed-methods thesis editing
* Detector-informed academic editing workflows

---

## What This Skill Is Not

This skill is **not**:

* An AI detector
* A detector bypass tool
* A plagiarism reduction tool
* A similarity-score reduction tool
* A third-party humanizer
* A full thesis generator
* A citation generator
* A tool for inventing research evidence
* A tool for making fake “human-like” errors
* A guarantee of Turnitin, CNKI, or any detector result

It does not encourage academic misconduct.
It is designed for conservative academic revision of user-provided thesis text.

## Quality Gates

Each revised paragraph or chapter should pass these checks:

| Gate   | Check                                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Gate A | AI-pattern reduction                        |
| Gate B | Academic integrity and protected elements   |
| Gate C | Meaning preservation                        |
| Gate D | Dash and punctuation integrity              |
| Gate E | Aggregation-worsening and breakpoint risk   |
| Gate F | Word-count preservation                     |
| Gate G | Structure and readability                   |
| Gate H | Sentence completeness and sentence length   |
| Gate I | Grammar, spelling, and capitalization       |
| Gate J | Logic flow and no misplaced meta-commentary |

If any gate fails, the revision is incomplete.

## Important Notes About Detector Scores

AI detector results can vary across tools, dates, settings, and document formats.

This skill treats detector results as external evidence, not as a guaranteed truth.

The skill may help reduce writing patterns that detectors often flag, but it cannot promise that:

* Turnitin AI will report a specific score
* CNKI AIGC will fall below a specific threshold
* Any detector will classify the text as human-written
* A rewritten version will always score lower

A rewritten chapter is only a candidate version until a comparable external re-test confirms improvement.

---

## Ethical Use

Use this skill only for legitimate academic revision.

Appropriate uses:

* Improving clarity while preserving meaning
* Reducing formulaic writing
* Removing excessive AI-polished patterns
* Protecting thesis originality
* Making the author’s actual reasoning more visible
* Reviewing detector-highlighted areas conservatively

Inappropriate uses:

* Submitting fabricated research
* Hiding ghostwritten work
* Manufacturing fake human style
* Bypassing academic integrity systems
* Replacing the author’s thesis with AI-generated prose

---

## FAQ

### Does this skill guarantee a lower Turnitin AI score?

No. It can reduce AI-writing risk patterns, but only an external re-test can confirm the actual detector result.

### Can it rewrite a full thesis at once?

No. The recommended workflow is chapter by chapter. Full-thesis batch rewriting increases the risk of over-editing, structure damage, and detector regression.

### Does it work for Chinese thesis text?

Yes. Chinese thesis text uses a separate Chinese AI-risk route rather than the English D1–D17 framework.

### Can it handle qualitative research?

Yes. It includes qualitative-specific checks for interviews, themes, quotations, participant meaning, researcher voice, and evidence-based interpretation.

### Can it use detector reports?

Yes. External detector reports can be used for calibration and prioritization, but the skill does not claim to reproduce detector logic.

### Is this a humanizer?

No. This skill explicitly rejects third-party humanizer logic. It focuses on academic integrity, minimal edits, and source-traceable revision.

### Does it intentionally add grammar mistakes?

No. It may preserve acceptable non-native academic style, but it never creates deliberate grammar or spelling errors.
